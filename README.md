# GoAnimate-Thumbnails
This repository is a storage location for stock-character thumbnails.  If you're curious, I got the item IDs by running a quick Powershell script to perform regex-search on [the theme files](https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper/GoAnimate-Wrapper/tree/master/themes).  The original file URLs follow the regex pattern below, with the numbers at the *end* being the file name saved on this repo:
```

```
